# Adaptative Livestreaming

This project aims to provide a easy configurable way to livestream a video and adapt the stream to the changes in a network.
This means that when the bandwidth available decreases/increases, the quality of the video should follow the same behaviour.

To analyse the Network status we  check the information of the Average RTT and the percentage of Packets Lost.
