# Python Dependencies

In this project I have used `Python 2.7` therefore all libraries should be compatible with this version:

## Install Python-nmap
We need to install python2-nmap library to be able to know the hosts available to receive the stream in our network:
 * `sudo apt-get install python2-nmap`


## Install Python-pip

We need to install pip to use  external libraries such as requests. We can do this by running:
 * `sudo apt-get install python2-pip`


### Install packages using pip

We need to install some packages for further use in python . We can do it by running :

 * `sudo pip2 install -r requirements.txt`



We now have all the needed packages and libraries needed to run the project, so we can start configuring some stuff.
